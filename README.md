# pEeR RevIeW
Inspired by Deep Autofill Chrome Extension by Stephan Ahlf - his code can be found at https://github.com/s-a/deep-autofill-chrome-extension.

Use this tool to automatically fill in useless Capstone peer reviews and farm that sweet, sweet 2% of your final grade!

## Installation
To install, simply clone this repo to your machine. Then, follow the steps shown below to use pEeR RevIeW!

1. Go to the extensions tab in Chrome (Settings -> More tools -> Extensions)
2. Ensure that Developer Mode is on, and click on the `Load Unpacked` button.
3. Navigate to the cloned repo and select the entire folder.
4. You're done! You can right click on the peer review page and select the `pEeR RevIeW` option to autofill the entire form. 

Note that pEeR RevIeW randomly selects from a predefined list of responses to speed up your form-filling time. If you want to add more possible responses, open run.js and edit the fakerResponsesAppreciate, fakerResponsesHate and fakerResponsesGroup arrays to your heart's content.
